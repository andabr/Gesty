Gesty

Project GestyWallPaper references AmbilWarna color picker project, that is a "library project". So pay attention when importing.

Current state of Gesty is feature-complete, but not final yet. Some resources and layouts are hard coded, list of resources not complete yet (current graphics is mostly mdpi), performance not yet optimized, needs more testing.

Used libraries:
http://code.google.com/p/android-color-picker/
android open source project (android.gesture)
some examples from "stack overflow" etc.

Old, but still relevant wireframes (pdf), as well as newer, but less complete overview (png), can be found in "docs".
